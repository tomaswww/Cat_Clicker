# Cat_Clicker

## Introduction

Cat_Clicker is a project that I developed for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program at Udacity.
The game's design was based on the famous Facebook game Cow Clicker, and following requests simulated by our Tutors at the nanodegree.

## Objective

This project is purely experimental and for learning purposes.
What I intended to do is put in practice concepts and skills learned throughout the nanodegree, such as Version control, browser events, MOV perspective using separation of concerns, etc.
ON the last part of the project I adopted Knockout framework.

## Documentation
